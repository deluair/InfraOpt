# InfraOpt

## Project Overview

InfraOpt is a comprehensive simulation platform for modeling and optimizing AI infrastructure economics under realistic constraints and market dynamics. This project addresses the critical challenge of efficiently allocating computational resources while balancing cost, energy consumption, performance, and sustainability goals across geographically distributed data centers.

## Problem Statement

The global AI infrastructure investment is projected to reach $5.2-7.9 trillion by 2030, with companies facing an 89% increase in computing costs between 2023-2025.
